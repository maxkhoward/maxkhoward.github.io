He was having trouble targeting various elements throughout the app because the majority of the elements he was trying to target just had vague classes (e.g &#8216;btn-primary&#8217;). But he was completely unable to speak with the development team.<\/p>\n<p>Part of the problem was that most people involved in the project were contractors and so they were not meeting regularly and discussing problems and solutions. The majority of communication was between them and the project manager. But these problems persist in a lot of companies that don&#8217;t even use contractors.<\/p>\n<p>I have friends who work for companies where developers are treated like special, frightened little pets. All lines of communication are cut between them and the rest of the company for the majority of the day, ostensibly to boost their productivity and prevent distractions.<\/p>\n<p>Now don&#8217;t get me wrong&#8230; I&#8217;m a developer and I am VERY special. But this sort of environment is counter-productive. It makes developers feel like children and makes everyone else in the company feel like developers are given special treatment. So right off the bat, everyone is frustrated.<\/p>\n<p>But most important &#8211; it means people are prevented from talking to and learning from each other. Had my friend been able to reach out and explain the situation they could have come to an understanding between each other that in order to easily track a users journey through the app, interactive elements would require unique ids in the rendered markup (not just unique keys). Instead, when he tried to pass a message via the manager it was misinterpreted and the solution provided several days later did not solve his problem. And in a rush to finish he turned to me and I was forced to whip up some inefficient CSS selector voodoo to track clicks.<\/p>\n<p>At Net-A-Porter my team worked closely with the design team. We would regularly have meetings, not just between myself and their team lead, but between all of us. And it would generate some great ideas. For example the decision to create an improved magazine-development tool came from these meetings when the designers said they were frustrated that they couldn&#8217;t make minor fixes themselves.<\/p>\n<p>This is just as (if not more) important when dealing with digital marketers and developers. The tools we use are so intertwined. Many developers (myself included) could benefit from some instruction on SEO best practices and marketers could get some assistance from developers when it comes to creating HTML content in their various platforms.

One of which came from some rather unique grid layouts. I&#8217;ll break these down into two categories, Flourishes and McMansions.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Flourishes<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The comps provided contained various grid layouts with small subtle oddities. I find a good approach during pre-development is to try and categorise all of these flourishes and open up a code-pen page to test various approaches for tackling each of them. Then when building the site you can create re-useable classes that you can tack on to any grid cell to apply these various flourishes.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium image\" src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/DXejRL1.png\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In the image above you can see two examples flourishes applied to the pink grid cell. &#8220;overflow-top&#8221; and &#8220;stretch-left&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;overflow-top&#8221; adds a psuedo element with the same background colour and width as the cell, and absolutely positions it with some negative &#8220;margin-top&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;stretch-left&#8221; does the same things but instead extends horizontally to the left all the way to the end of the page. It does this by aligning itself to the right of the cell and having a width of 100vw. By tackling this early on, whenever these came up throughout development I just had to add the appropriate class and my job was done.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium image\" src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/K0aCA3l.png\" \/><\/p>\n<p>I strongly recommend spending as much time as possible reviewing comps and looking for problematic areas as soon as they are handed off. Nothing worse than late game surprises. Especially when you come across our next grid-breaker.<\/p>\n<p><strong>McMansions<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Sometimes you praise a designer for their use of grids. Other times the grids look so overly complex and rigid you have no idea where to begin building the actual structure. Hence, McMansions. Here&#8217;s an example:<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium image\" src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/bXR5bwi.png\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This might seem relatively simple at first glance. A few grid based elements on-top of a half dark background. At first I thought I would just add a dark div and maybe apply some negative margins to it. But look closer. There are lines that connect which cannot be broken. The black background behind the lower half of this section lines up perfectly with the line of the green box. That green boxes position and size is dependent on the content within it AND the content above it. In order to keep these types of elements as flexible as possible, I tried to ignore the content and looked at it as a pure, grid structure. By breaking it down into a set of cells, you could then define the content areas as sections that span multiple cells. The image below should give you an idea of how this works.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium image\" src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/W9OzjWV.png\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This image is a zoomed out version. Notice how all the text has reflowed onto more lines and yet the elements all still line-up correctly. This is the power of the CSS-GRID. Additionally, when breaking to the mobile view we are able to reorder all these elements using the\u00a0<em>order<\/em> propery.<\/p>\n<p>McMansions are not always so simple. If you&#8217;re stuck with one I recommend reaching out to your designers and asking them how they think content should reflow on different screen sizes. They might find a solution you couldn&#8217;t immediately see.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This year&#8217;s Adobe Summit site came with some unique challenges.

One thing I did slightly differently this year is to keep ALL animation styles in one file. I did this for two reasons. First it encouraged me to reuse animations I&#8217;d already written (I don&#8217;t like creating messy SASS files). Secondly, I knew what some of the feedback we would receive would be. &#8220;Can you speed up all the animations just a touch&#8221; or &#8220;can we make the animations a little smoother&#8221;.

They&#8217;re simple enough to create from scratch with tons of resources out there to get you started and most front-end frameworks (Bootstrap, Foundation etc.) come bundled with various nav components that work out of the box. However I recently discovered a situation in which these typical approaches do not apply.<\/p>\n<p>The platform I work on has a WYSIWYG site editor, built to allow large corporations to quickly deploy custom sites for their events. When you create pages for a site you can choose to add the page to the site nav. Event managers LOVE creating new pages. They want landing pages for various promotions, info pages for all the demographics their event caters to and often individual pages for each track\/session for their event. In my experience this is especially true of government organisations.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"image\" src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/KhlQhsd.png\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">This is the site for a Dutch municipality I did some work for back in 2014<\/p>\n<p>When these start getting added to the nav it quickly becomes clustered and can often overflow the boundaries of the nav container at which point you have to decide how to handle that overflow. My preferred approach would be to break to some sort of equivalent of a mobile nav, where the top level nav links can be hidden behind a button press. This is not ideal but it&#8217;s not our job to tell event managers how to create their sites. It is our job to design our tools in such a way that they cannot break no matter how they are used.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"image\" src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/oRBkVws.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The problem with most navs is that their desktop and mobile views switch at some arbitrary breakpoint (using css media-queries), not when the nav becomes too full. But there&#8217;s a better way. Now we could use javascript to measure the width of all the nav elements and break to a mobile view when necessary but this kind of approach is pretty messy. There&#8217;s another way. A flexbox way.<\/p>\n<p>Try editing <a class=\"link\" href=\"https:\/\/codepen.io\/maxkhoward\/pen\/yzvgwN\" target=\"new\">this pen<\/a>. You&#8217;ll notice that it breaks to a mobile view not only when you reduce the screensize but also if you add too many links. (Note: This does not include the actual dropdown component).<\/p>\n<p>So what&#8217;s happening here? The nav is acting as a small window into a flexbox container. This container has two elements. The nav items and the logo to the left. The nav items are set to stretch and fill the entire width of the container (hiding the absolutely positioned mobile nav icon on the right). When the nav items fill their div, the nav items all wrap together (in reverse) above the logo, leaving nothing but a logo and the now showing mobile nav icon. You can get a clearer look at this in action by removing the explicit height of the nav.<\/p>\n<p><video class=\"video\" style=\"max-width: 100%; min-height: 364px;\" autoplay=\"autoplay\" loop=\"loop\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\"><source type=\"video\/mp4\" src=\"\/\/i.imgur.com\/zgDqHaK.mp4\" \/><\/video><\/p>\n<p>The advantage of this approach is that it is very fast and flexible (excuse the pun). Fast because CSS rendering will generally outperform JS. Flexible because if you want to break to a mobile view at a different screensize you still can. In fact you can change almost anything about this nav by just applying additional css. This is extremely important in our application where sites are built from react components with some bare-bones css, then have additional &#8220;theme styles&#8221; applied on top. That means our themes can include breakpoints if theme designers feel so inclined.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There are plenty of approaches to handling site\/app navigation out there.

Now I&#8217;ve recovered from the shock of being done I look back at that work more lovingly and now want to give a brief overview of what I accomplished.<\/p>\n<p>My thesis is titled, &#8220;Morphology and Control Optimisation of the Spring Loaded Inverted Pendulum Model Using Genetic Algorithms&#8221;. Five months ago this title would&#8217;ve confused and excited me. When I read it now I interpret it the way it should be interpreted. &#8220;Simulating a walking spring and making it walk better by applying some well known and well documented optimisation algorithms&#8221;. I don&#8217;t mean this cynically. The scientific lexicon isn&#8217;t meant to be friendly to outsiders and every bachelor thesis is treading common ground, however that doesn&#8217;t mean that I am unhappy with my work. In fact quite the opposite. I know how much effort I put into this project because of how well I now understand it. In order to explain it I&#8217;m going to define some of those key terms in the title.<\/p>\n<h4>Spring Loaded Inverted Pendulum (SLIP) model<\/h4>\n<p>The Spring-loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP) is a model of the centre-of-mass dynamics of the running gaits of humans and other animals. The SLIP model\u2019s benefit derives from it\u2019s simplicity and self-stabilising nature. This makes SLIP models good templates for bipedal or multi-pedal running robots, especially when applied to rugged terrains. SLIPs consist of a mass atop a linear spring of a certain stiffness k. The task of the SLIP model at any given step is to choose an angle of attack \u03b1 (the angle the spring makes with the ground when landing) that results in the SLIP returning to its flight phase (not falling over). So in short, it falls, connects with the ground, converts it&#8217;s kinetic energy into elastic potential energy while the mass moves over the leg (stance phase) and then (if successful) releases this energy and lanuches back into the air, continuing it&#8217;s majestic strides. The SLIP model can be as simple or as complicated as you want. Leg mass models, additional forces, and multiple legs can be incorporated for more advanced research. In robotics for example, it was used as a framework in the development of the one and only <a class=\"link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=wE3fmFTtP9g\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WildCat<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/-Vf4O9nhm3v8\/V4qD1t6sfVI\/AAAAAAAAAaE\/Ifo5-sM-e1UqQajTucKva9DQzGDnpGwnQCLcB\/s320\/SLIP-stancephase.jpg\" width=\"320\" height=\"320\" border=\"0\" \/><\/p>\n<h4>Genetic Algorithms (GAs)<\/h4>\n<p>Most people interested in coding or tech have a basic understanding of Genetic Algorithms. By implementing a similar procedure to Darwinian natural selection, it is possible to optimise inputs into some system such that the output reaches some global maximum or minimum. For example we can find the global maximum of several different types of benchmark functions such as the Rastrigin function using Genetic Algorithms. In fact the Rastrigin function was one of the functions I used to test my Genetic Algorithm.<\/p>\n<p>The steps involved in a genetic algorithm are as follows. Initialisation (randomly generating a population of &#8220;solutions&#8221;, in this case, Springs), Testing (Finding out how good the solutions are i.e. how many times the springs bounce while moving forwards), Selection (choosing which population members should breed), Crossover (Taking the parameters that define each solution and randomly crossing them over with other selected solutions) and Mutation (adding a bit of random variation).<\/p>\n<p>Each of these individual steps have had huge amounts of researched poured into them. I had to make decisions on what to use at each step of the algorithm and also choose which ones would be worthy of exploring via the testing of different approaches in order to keep my research interesting and original<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"image\" src=\"https:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/-Sdgz-VEPUhw\/V4qD9Nv3B5I\/AAAAAAAAAaI\/raC6SdwVDHomBttE9fmBkFPaCBW55a9jgCLcB\/s400\/GA.gif\" width=\"400\" height=\"393\" border=\"0\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">A simple model of a G.A<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"image\" src=\"https:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/-_OLZv6wk-L4\/V4qD9UnqW_I\/AAAAAAAAAaM\/FcM9j9ELFGgrTzKh2EKg_v1kCWGQRrAUACLcB\/s400\/gatest.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"170\" border=\"0\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Benchmark functions used to test a GAs ability to find global optima among local optima.<\/p>\n<h4>All the rest of it<\/h4>\n<p>So what was I optimising in the SLIP model using GAs? In terms of morphology I was attempting to optimise the stiffness parameter of the spring. This is the value k from Hookes Law which you probably saw in a physics class at some point (F = -kX). The other thing I optimised were the rate parameters in my linear controllers. These determined the angle that the spring should make with the ground when it is about to land. This angle is based on 2 things, the springs current speed and it&#8217;s height at the apex of the flight phase. The angle is then based on a linear combination of these two parameters. The values alpha and beta act as coefficients of these values and determine the degree to which they effect the output (the angle of attack).<br \/>\nOnce everything was set up, experiments were run on terrains of varying roughness. This roughness is a built in parameter of the midpoint displacement algorithm which I used in the generation of rugged terrains. I could then evolve springs of various terrains and test how well they were able to traverse these maps. The graphs below show how many steps a spring of stiffness k (y-axis) was able to take before falling on terrain of roughness r (x-axis). The upper graph is for springs with no control strategies applied and the lower one is with a basic control strategy applied. After this was done I applied the genetic algorithms.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"image\" src=\"https:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/-K-KI94KI9MA\/V4qEFRyctCI\/AAAAAAAAAaQ\/cqQ9jskXK94_SOCpri8wIR2RffiN7xLFwCLcB\/s400\/pretests.jpg\" width=\"239\" height=\"400\" border=\"0\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Each cell represents a test on a single Spring Loaded Pendulum with leg stiffness k (y-axis) on terrain roughness r (x-axis). The colour of the cell indicates how many steps the spring took. Above is an experiment on a controller using predetermined coefficients (decided via limited analysis by me). Below is the controller which has been optimised by the GA. Clearly the GA was able to pull the red boundary further to the right, meaning it was able to tackle tougher terrains.<\/p>\n<p>In the end the genetic algorithms worked great. The relatively small solution space showed that even on very rough terrains, convergence to a good solution came quickly (I can&#8217;t really say global optimum because there&#8217;s no guarantee that one exists, let alone that my GAs found it). Additional tests also gave interesting insight into some differences between different GA approaches. No doubt the most rewarding experience however came after my final presentation when I was defending my thesis. Several people in the audience were kind enough to throw questions at me and I found myself genuinely enjoying the experience of justifying my approaches and going into details about my implementation. It was the ultimate end of level boss battle in which I used everything I&#8217;d learned other the prior 4 months to fight off multiple enemies and and hope for those attacks to rebound and stun them while I went in for the power attacks. It was a great end to my thesis and to my degree and while I may not be taking the research further, I have actually started work on another SLIP model project. More on that later though.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>From April to June a lot of my time was dedicated research and development of my thesis.

It&#8217;s quite adorable.<\/p>\n<p>After implementing the methods outlined in my previous post (to find the points of intersection in the board) we then had to convert this pixel data into some X,Y,Z coordinate in euclidean space, relative to the robot. In order to limit the problems we decided to assume the board would always be horizontally oriented and we also decided to restrict the height of the board and have it be input into the system at run time based on physical measurements. That&#8217;s the Y coordinate taken care of (and from that, the vertical distance from the camera to the board). Next up we had to tackle that pesky Z coordinate. Well fortunately enough Alderbaraan (the company that makes the NAO robot) offers detailed specifications on the cameras location and field of view. All we had to do was map the points of the image, to these angular values and we would then have an angle to work with. To do this mapping we took the proportions of the board position in the image (with respect to the images dimensions) and applied this to the angular range of the cameras field of view. In other words, if the center of the game board was located 66% from the top of the image taken by the camera, we would assume that it was also located 66% from the top of the field of view of the camera. From this we had our angle and could use trigonometry to find the Z coordinate of any given point of interest in the image. The X coordinate was found using a similar method (see images below), but depended on our previously found Z distance.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"image\" src=\"https:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/-DnzzNcKyw7w\/V4qAdJycXwI\/AAAAAAAAAZg\/5vsun9ZY-t0pWYrX_824_BGM4DGarLoDwCLcB\/s400\/image03.png\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" border=\"0\" \/><\/p>\n<p>From everything we had acheived so far we had the following system. A system that could take an image, find a Tic-Tac-Toe board (if it existed) in that image, find the points of intersection of the board and then determine the distance in all X,Y,Z coordinates from those points to the camera. At this point our system was ready to be utilised by the robot and experimented on. The accompanying graphs show the the error in the calculated Z and X distances with respect to the actual distance from the centre of the field of view of the robot. As you can see for our Z distances we found a linear error. PERFECT! We just had to adjust our calculations by some constant. Once we&#8217;d done that, our X error became linear (as there were no longer large errors in the Z value propagating through the system and effecting the X calculations). The results of these adjustments were fantastic. We were able to repeatedly calculate board positions to within 2mm, which was a fine degree of accuracy when playing tic-tac-toe. Our job was done.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"image\" src=\"https:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/-0SDLL86bxV4\/V4qAkbVVqyI\/AAAAAAAAAZk\/QM0u0rp3enoT7gPj2G_x3YUtQwlVPBnKQCLcB\/s400\/image60.png\" width=\"400\" height=\"258\" border=\"0\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"image\" src=\"https:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/-K7irJ6FhAC4\/V4qAkn1F-zI\/AAAAAAAAAZo\/ezKTcfr83lcLFSnzH3L7MFIwSHKP7j52gCLcB\/s400\/image61.png\" width=\"400\" height=\"255\" border=\"0\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately the Kinematics team were not able to develop a functional IK solver.

This time around we were tasked with programming a NAO robot to play Tic-Tac-Toe. I instantly knew I was gonna like this one. It was daunting at first but after some research on Inverse Kinematic solvers and the oh so wonderful Open CV library I was feeling confident. First we split into teams. One group working on building a Fabrik Algorithm and all other tasks associated with kinematics, the other on visual processing and localisation. I was in the latter group. The first thing we set about doing was building a system that could determine if there was a tic-tac-toe board (hashtag shape) in an image. We would also require some information on the location of key points of this board in order to be able to determine the location of the squares of the board<\/p>\n<h4>Why not use Neural Networks?<\/h4>\n<p>Okay ANNs are powerful. Incredibly powerful. They definitely have their place. However for this task we wanted to understand the geometry of the board. In order to do that we had to find the points of intersection of the lines and if we were going to do that, well why bother training a network only to have to further find the geometry of the shape anyway. If we trained the ANN to find these points of intersection they would likely find all sorts of other intersecting lines too (in the background of the image). So the approach we took was to try and exploit the unique shape of a hashtag.<\/p>\n<p>Our algorithm first attempts to eliminate some noise. We achieve this by applying some limited blurring and then thresholding the image (limiting the image to pure blacks and pure whites). We used adaptive thresholding which means that the decision to turn a pixel white or black is based on the mean brightness of the subregion that the pixel is located in. This stops (for example) shadows in the image converting a whole region to black when details within the shaded region need to be retained. After this we applied a Hough Transform to find straight lines in the image.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"image\" src=\"https:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/-n7iNiBn0xWY\/V4ni8Ls5FGI\/AAAAAAAAAZM\/lrjFiLSw60wTprGTb6lu2jV1CyDOTcENACLcB\/s320\/image23.jpg\" width=\"320\" height=\"213\" border=\"0\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">The lines found via a Hough Transform, redrawn over the original image. Notice the huge amounts of overlapping lines in the background.<\/p>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<p>We now had several lines to work with (and their coordinates). We split them into two groups at first (horizontal and vertical). In order for them to be of any use I guessed that we had to further group them in some fashion however it is not obvious how at first (should they be grouped by proximity, length..?). Fortunately I&#8217;d just been introduced to the notion of hierarchical clustering. This allowed us to group the lines based on one condition &#8211; if a line intersects with another line, they are in the same group. After implementing this hierarchical clustering algorithm we then averaged the lines using the extreme points of each set and were left with one line representing each cluster. Now we had to try and understand which lines represented the board and which were just noise.<\/p>\n<p>A hashtag actually has a very specific set of rules regarding its shape. They consist of 4 lines and they intersect in a cyclic bipartite fashion, i.e line 1, intersects line 2 and line 3, but not line 4 (thanks Graph Theory!). So in order to find the hashtag all we had to do was test on each line whether we could &#8216;walk&#8217; from that line, across three other unique lines connected in series and then end up back at our first line. If we could do that then we had found our board and using some simple mathematics we could find the points of intersection too, which would ultimately define the shape we were working with. Next up, localisation. But I think I&#8217;ll save that for another post. I&#8217;ve rambled to the void long enough for one evening.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"image\" src=\"https:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/-dO5TV7b3MDI\/V4ni8HzKaCI\/AAAAAAAAAZQ\/ErKHjJHr1qss894lWE9xsYnG0CgBtxY3wCLcB\/s320\/image40.jpg\" width=\"320\" height=\"213\" border=\"0\" \/><\/p>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Another project.

There were several constraints (environement, physics and sensory input mainly), but the strategies themselves were up to us. I was lucky enough to be working with some very talented programmers and we had a simulation platform up and running in a couple of weeks, with a simple AI template class ready for implementation (for those of the team less comfortable with code). We then split into teams (scrums), Guard Programmers vs Intruder Programmers.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"two-thirds column\">\n<p>My colleague and I (Guards) set about implementing the most googleable techniques we could find. First up was using the influence map. The results were instantly better than our previous brute-force search approach. Next up we added some clever modifications. For example, during the first iteration of the influence map, if a guard saw an intruder and then lost sight of it, the probability values surrounding that cell would update in an expanding circular pattern with the last known location of the intruder at the epicenter. We made it slightly more reliable by actually offsetting these circles, based on the vector of the intruder, i.e if the guard was seen running in one direction it is more likely that it remained on that bearing than it turned around. (see images below) All these approaches worked well but none of them were particularly original and we were having problems with the guards frequently losing sight of the intruders (the intruders were able to sprint in short bursts, allowing them to evade capture if they knew they had been seen). Additionally we wanted to include an approach that limited communication between the guards (at that moment they were using a shared influence map).<\/p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"https:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/-HnVxfCi0WIY\/V4K422_60vI\/AAAAAAAAAXQ\/oGkLBR1Y1Z4ckYM8v3aL3tj6fBrq6b_2gCLcB\/s1600\/conwave.jpg\"><img src=\"https:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/-HnVxfCi0WIY\/V4K422_60vI\/AAAAAAAAAXQ\/oGkLBR1Y1Z4ckYM8v3aL3tj6fBrq6b_2gCLcB\/s400\/conwave.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"133\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><\/div>\n<p>Well during an evening in front of a nature documentary I found exactly what I was looking for. A system of intelligent agents that could chase and catch prey in small packs using limited communication. From what I gathered (I&#8217;m recalling what I took from the documentary, not what it had explicitly stated), when wolves hunt, one stays behind the prey keeping pace while others attempt to flank them, giving them small bites here and there in an attempt to slow them down while remaining safe from direct attacks that might occurr if they took on their prey head on. This notion of hunting in teams and using flanking techniques formed the basis for our AI, as did the method of marking territory which became useful when dividing up the map between packs in order to maximise the search area.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"image alignnone size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/-TP2HyoPFOVU\/V4mpXzRxlVI\/AAAAAAAAAYw\/452rsPye_KkZBTR3Ti2HTzLVz069WjcZACLcB\/s400\/wolf.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"225\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; font-weight: 800;\">Flanking<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"two-thirds column\">\n<p>After deciding that we would split our guards into packs of two, and have them hunt together we then had to work on flanking. So how can flanking be programmed into a non-deterministic environment (our maps were randomly generated), afterall it is not necessarily obvious which path to take in order to flank succesfully? It took a while for us just to understand the problem. We thought for a long time about predicting the intruders movements and trying to take paths that would allow them to somehow cut them off at some given crossroad but after a while we came to realise that we may have been over thinking it. After all the wolves have no way of actually knowing for sure that their prey and going to turn the way they expect them to. All that matters is that they take the &#8216;next best path&#8217;, whatever that might be at any given time. Well that&#8217;s simple enough using the A* algorithm we had already implemented. However this &#8216;next best path&#8217; was quite often the &#8216;first best path&#8217; (the one used by that chaser), but with some unnecessary detour. We then decided that all the cells used in the best path would be assigned large(ish) weights when determing the second best path. The result was a much better chasing algorithm. (see the video at the bottom)<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"image\" src=\"https:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-zNREoN8x-X8\/V4K5FPbnsaI\/AAAAAAAAAXU\/3PJ7SkHkTWkYoCZWygdpXbWyLpHEO4KkgCLcB\/s400\/flank.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"147\" border=\"0\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Our Wolf Pack AI didn&#8217;t work as well as our fully communicated influence map AI. This is to be expected as we were imposing limitations and then trying to overcome them. The limitations in communiation hinder it from exploring the map in an optimal fashion. However when we added the flanking algorithm to the AI that used a shared influence map, we saw a fantastic improvement in the ability of the guards to capture the intruders once they were seen. It really is a rewarding experience seeing positive results from your own (kinda) original idea. Like if my amateurly produced Newgrounds DVD business back in school had taken off, (I guess I figured there was a market for stuff that was free on the internet already).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"row\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe style=\"margin: 0 auto; text-align: centre;\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/RDVZSQXQpqM\" width=\"420\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A project recently tasked us with building a multiagent simulation, the goal of which was to implement different strategies for an agent-based surveillence system, where a set of intruders enter the environment and search for the goal, while a set of guards hunt them down.
